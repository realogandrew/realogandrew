## Hi there 👋

🔍 My name is Andrew and I'm a full stack software engineer with a deep focus on creating beautiful Front End experiences. I primarily work in Node and React but sometimes dabble in Python and the dreaded PHP. I love dinking on the Pickleball courts, cooking soup, and playing video games. 

🔭 I work at Nike as a senior software engineer, working on solving challenges in the creative production workspace.

🌱 In 2025, I am going to continue learning new technologies or improving my skills in existing ones, including:
- NextJS 
- Building APIs (not just a basic CRUD but something that actually is useful for myself and/or others)
- Building applications in iOS
